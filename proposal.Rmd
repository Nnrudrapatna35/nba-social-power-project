### Project Description


- What is the research question you wish to explore? 
*This includes an introduction to the subject matter youâ€™re investigating, the motivation for the for your research question (citing any relevant literature), and your hypotheses regarding the research question of interest.*


- Describe the dataset you wish to explore. 
*This includes describing the observations in the data, a general description of the variables, and how the data was originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it.)*

## The Data

Finally, we will examine the relevant variables in the dataset:

```{r glimpse-nba-social-power}
glimpse(nba_social_power) # entire dataset

nba_social_power_mod <- nba_social_power %>%
  filter(TWITTER_HANDLE != "0") %>%
  select(PLAYER_NAME, 
         TEAM_ABBREVIATION,
         AGE,
         W_PCT,
         OFF_RATING,
         DEF_RATING,
         NET_RATING,
         AST_RATIO,
         REB_PCT,
         USG_PCT,
         PIE,
         SALARY_MILLIONS,
         ACTIVE_TWITTER_LAST_YEAR,
         TWITTER_FOLLOWER_COUNT_MILLIONS,
         PTS) 

glimpse(nba_social_power_mod) # modified dataset for analysis
